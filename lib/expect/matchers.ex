  alias Expect.Matchers.CustomMatcher

  @moduledoc """
    A matcher is responsible for providing `expect/2` three things

    1. the name for the matcher
    2. the value that was matched against (optional)
    3. a function to invoke with the given value to `expect()`

    Expect will invoke the matcher's function, and if it returns `false` or an error tuple, it will
    construct an error message using the name and the value, and fail the test.

    For example, given a matcher that returns `%CustomMatcher{name: "end with", actual: "cool", fn: fn given -> String.ends_with?(given, "cool") end}`,
    we could expect the following result

    ```
    expect("literal fire", to: end_with("cool"))
    # raises an error with message "Expected '"literal fire"' to end with '"cool"', but it did not"
    ```

    Alternatively, a matcher that returns `%CustomMatcher{name: "be greater than", actual: 5, fn: fn given -> given > 5 end}`
    would have the following result

    ```
    expect(0, to: be_greater_than(5))
    # raises an error with message "Expected '0' to be greater than '5'"
    ```

    # Custom failure messages

    By default, when a matcher fails, the error message will use the name of the matcher, and the value matched against.

    eg: given a matcher returns `%CustomMatcher{name: "start with", actual: "gravy", fn: fn given -> String.starts_with?(given, "gravy") end}`
    we could expect the following line to fail

    ```
    expect("groovy train", to: start_with("gravy"))
    # fails with message "Expected '\"groovy train\"' to start with '\"gravy\"'"
    ```

    If you are writing a matcher that doesn't compare the given value against something else, you can omit the `actual` key
    (only the `name` and `fn` keys are required)

    ```
    def start_with_a, do: %CustomMatcher{name: "start with the letter 'A'", fn: fn given -> String.starts_with?(given, "A") end}`

    expect("algebra", to: start_with_a())
    # passes

    expect("monotonic", to: start_with_a())
    # fails with message "Expected '"monotonic"' to start with the letter 'a'"
    ```

    # Custom error messages

    Sometimes, a matcher might receive input that it is incapable of dealing with. A matcher that wants to
    verify if a string has a certain prefix would be unable to handle input that is not a string. This can be
    handled by returning an error tuple from a matcher

    ```
    def end_with(suffix) do: %CustomMatcher{name: "end with", actual: suffix, fn: &verify_suffix(&1, suffix)}

    defp verify_suffix(given, suffix) when is_binary(given), do: String.ends_with?(given, suffix)
    defp verify_suffix(given, suffix), do: {:error, "end with '#\{suffix}', but it was not a string"}
    ```
